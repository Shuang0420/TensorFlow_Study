[visualization](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/how_tos/summaries_and_tensorboard/index.html)
tensorboard --logdir=path/to/log-directory
where logdir points to the directory where the SummaryWriter serialized its data. If this logdir directory contains subdirectories which contain serialized data from separate runs, then TensorBoard will visualize the data from all of those runs. Once TensorBoard is running, navigate your web browser to localhost:6006 to view the TensorBoard.
